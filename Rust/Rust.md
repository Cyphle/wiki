## Cargo, the package manager
* Cargo is Rust build system and package manager
* `cargo build --release` builds the project. Release option is to create a release
* `cargo run` builds and run the project
* `cargo check` check if program is compilable
* `cargo new <project_name>` new cargo project
* `cargo update` updates dependencies
* `cargo doc --open` generates a doc of dependencies of current project

## Principles
* Rust is immutable by default. To tell a variable is mutable use `mut`
* An associated function is a function that's implemented on a type, like `String::new`
* Rust is references `&` to optimize memory. No need to create copies of objects
* A `crate` is a Rust collection source code files
* Rust allows to shadow a variable by using its name multiple times
```
let maVariable = "Coucou"

let maVariable: u32 = 12
```

## Base concepts
* Variables are immutables
* When typing a variable can lead to multiple types, like parsing a string, have to add a type annotation `let myVar: u32 = "32".parse...`
* Compound types
    * Tuples can hold variables of multiple types. They have a fix size, once declare, cannot change size. `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`. Can spread `let (x, y, z) = tup`
    * Arrays can hold variables of same type. They have a fix length. Can be initialize directly or specified with type and length. `let months = ["Janvier", "Février"]; let a: [i32, 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
* Rust is multi paradigm
* Rust use snake case for functions and variables as convention

## Loops
* loop creates an infinite loop
```
loop {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Macros
* Calls with `!`. Example: `println!`. If call function `println`
