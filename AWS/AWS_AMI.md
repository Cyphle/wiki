# What are AMI

AMI, Amazon Machine Image, are virtual machines (VM) images. They are used to be deployed on servers such as AWS EC2.

It is possible to create our own AMI.

The AMI are specific to regions (an AMI in region cannot be found in another region). But they can be copied accross regions.
