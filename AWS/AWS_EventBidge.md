# What is EventBridge ?

It is the evolution of CloudWatch event

# CloudWatch Events

* Create event from event pattern or schedule from sources to targets to do something
* Event pattern: intercept event from services (sources)
    * Ex: EC2 instance start, codebuild failure, s3, trusted advisor
    * Can intercept any API call with cloudtrail integration
* Schedule or cron (ex: create an event every 4 hours)
* JSON payload is created from event and passed to target
    * Lambda, batch, ecs
    * sqs, sns, kinesis
    * step function
    * ssm, ec2 actions
* CloudWatch event is now Event bridge and it will disappear

# Notes

* Default event bus: generated by AWS services (equivalent to CloudWatch Event)
* Partner Events Bus: Evolution to add partner event bus with EventBridge to receive events from SaaS services or applications (Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0, ...)
* Custom Event Buses: for own applications
* Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts
* Archive events
* Can replay archived events
* Schema registry available which can be versioned
