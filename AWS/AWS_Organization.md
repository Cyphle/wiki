# What is Organization ?

* Allow to group account

# Notes
* Allow to put mutiple accounts into an organization to manage all in one place
* Billing stream up to the organization
* When creating a child account from the organization console, AWS set an IAM role with administration rights and can be assumed from the parent account. It is convenient as it allows to authenticate to the child AWS account without having to create any IAM users or IAM roles.
