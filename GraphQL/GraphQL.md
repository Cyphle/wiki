# GraphQL

## What is a graph
A graph is a requestable structure of data.

### Resolvers
They resolve the schemas and know how to fetch data depending on operation.

## Conventions
* Field names should use camelCase.
* Type names should use PascalCase.
* Enum names should use PascalCase.
* Enum values should use ALL_CAPS.

## Authentication


## Notes
* Every object in schema has a "__typename" field autogenerated that is the name of the object in string. Can be used to know what it is returned. __typename field can be requested in a GraphQL query
* GraphQL is not meant to send multi part requests (files). It is better to use REST in this case
* Schema stitching is the principal to merge multiple GraphQL schemas to make one. For instance, if we have two GraphQL endpoints and want data from both, we can make a request that stitches both instead of making two calls.
